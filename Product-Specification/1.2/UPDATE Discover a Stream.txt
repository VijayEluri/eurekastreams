![](images/featuredPopular.png)

1. The list of featured streams, both groups and people, in the order of when they were featured, with the most recent first
2. Pager controls which set of 3 featured streams the user sees. When clicked, the streams should slide over until there's the next or previous 3 streams (depending on which button is hit). If there are no more streams in any given direction, that direction's button should be disabled.
3. The follow button shows up only if the user hasn't followed the group/person and allows them to follow it from here. When clicked the button disappears and a notifcation appears saying "You are now following [Stream Name]"
4. Search box functions exactly the same as the box on the top of the page
5. The browse button opens the browse all streams modal (see below).
