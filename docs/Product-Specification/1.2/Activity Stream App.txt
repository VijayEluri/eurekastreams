### App View

1. Search bar follows the Standard UX guidelines for search and searches against the stream 
2. Tabs allow user to sort by recent, popular and active. Sorts should behave the same way they do in the stream 
3. Page up button should be disabled if the user is already at the top of the list and should allow them to scroll up when clicked and held.  
4. Page down button should be disabled if the user is already at the bottom of the list and should allow them to scroll down when clicked and held
