##User experience

### Performing a keyword search

![](images/PS_F15_searchstream_hashtags_fig01.png)

1. Keyword search can be performed on hashtags.  Searching on hashtags returns an exact match on the keywords.  In this example, only posts with #scrum (in upper or lower case) are returned in the results.

### Saving a keyword search

1. The knowledge worker can name the search, the search keywords are populated in this field by default.
2. The knowledge worker can edit the search criteria they originally entered.
3. The knowledge worker can save a search from a profile activity stream and the activity page. The following are the expected results depending on where the search is saved.
    * When a search is successfully saved from a profile activity stream, the knowledge worker is returned to the profile page, feedback displays at the top of the page with a close option: "Your search has been successfully saved", and the + Save Search link is still displayed in the stream.  If one or both of the required fields are left blank the following message appears above the form: "Please enter a name and at least one keyword".  Refer to the [Action Feedback UI design pattern](/docs/product-specification/user-experience-guidelines/action-feedback/) for additional details.
    * When a search is successfully saved from the Activity page, the knowledge worker is returned to the new search stream and displays at the top of the page with a close option: "Your search has been successfully saved." If one or both of the required fields are left blank the following message appears above the form: "Please enter a name and at least one keyword".  Refer to the [Action Feedback UI design pattern](/docs/product-specification/user-experience-guidelines/action-feedback/) for additional details.
