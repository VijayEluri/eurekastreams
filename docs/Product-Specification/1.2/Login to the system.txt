## Overview


Logging into the system is based on the credentials of the user and authentication schemes being used. A Knowledge Worker with access to the system authenticates. A Knowledge Worker who does not have access to the system needs to request access.


## Conditions of satisfaction

01. The Knowledge Worker must be able to request access if he is not authorized to login to the system.
02. The Knowledge Worker must be able to login via a form authenticating credentials against a kerberos or ldap backend.
03. The Knowledge Worker must be able to login via the http negotiate protocol authenticating credentials against a kerberos backend.


## User experience

01. Valid user name must be entered.
02. Valid password must be entered. Password is masked when typed.
03. Remembers the user name and password after initial login and automatically logs the user in when launching Eureka Streams.
04. Logs user into Eureka Streams or displays a message on invalid login: "The username or password you entered is incorrect"
05. Return user to the EurekaStreams.org website.

## Test plans



1. **Verify the ability to request access if not authorized to login to the system**
    *  Verify employees without access are presented with the Eureka login screen
    *  Verify there is a link to request access 
    *  Verify that if integrated authentication is implemented, the user name and password fields are not displayed
    *  Verify that if integrated authentication is not implemented, the user name and password fields are displayed
2. **Verify the ability to login via a form authenticating credentials against a kerberos or ldap backend**
    *  Verify the Knowledge Worker needs to enter his user name and password  
    *  Verify the Knowledge Worker can select the keep me logged in option
    *  Verify the terms of service display when a new Knowledge Worker logs in
    *  Verify the Knowledge Worker is not prompted for login information if the keep me logged in option was enabled on login
3. **Verify the ability to login via the http negotiate protocol authenticating credentials against a kerberos backend**
    *  Verify the Knowledge Worker is automatically logged if he has access
