<<<<<<< .merge_file_vrcMlj
A page represents the root container in which all information is presented to the Knowledge Worker. A page is comprised of one or more tabs with each tab containing a set of apps. The setup of these tabs and apps is configurable. Additionally, a page may be personalized by applying a theme. The product supports two basic page types: a personal start page and a profile.
## Tab
A tab provides a container and context for a set of apps. The tab has a name and a configurable layout supporting the drag-and-drop of apps within and across columns. A Knowledge Worker may directly share a tab and its associated apps with a colleague or publish it to the gallery for others to reuse.
## Apps
An app provides a view of information from either an internal or external source. Apps enable the Knowledge Worker to make effective decisions by surfacing relevant data or perform simple activities within an application. An app may be socially-aware supporting the mashup of enterprise information within the context of the Knowledge Worker's profile and social network. A collection of apps are available within the gallery and can be placed on any page. Additionally, they may be shared directly with colleagues.
## Theme
A theme is comprised of a set of images and color schemes that may be applied to a page. A theme allows a Knowledge Worker to personalize their start page and brand a profile of an organization or group.
## Start Page
The start page provides Knowledge Workers with a private home page that they can theme and customize to display news and streams of activity.  A collection of apps from the gallery can be placed on the Knowledge Workers start page.  Apps can be grouped under tabs in order to organize the start page. Unlike traditional enterprise web portals, Knowledge Workers not only have complete control over the content but they may also apply a theme to change the look and feel.
## Gallery
Gallery can be updated with default apps and themes. Organizations are responsible for vetting what items are available within the gallery for their employees.
## Profile
A profile is a page that displays information representing an employee, group, or organization. This information may assist Knowledge Workers in the discovery of expertise within the enterprise. An organization is responsible for establishing the default configuration for employee and group profiles. If the organization's social media policy permits, an administrator may customize a profile by choosing a theme and additional apps.
##Stream Plugin
Stream plug-ins can be configured to provide the employee or group with the most up to date data from sources such as delicious, google reader, or youtube.
## Activity Streams
Activity Streams provide Knowledge Workers with an efficient way to aggregate, organize and engage in conversation around information.  An activity stream is a set of activity aggregated from multiple sources. This activity may be published automatically by feeds or applications. Additionally, a Knowledge Worker may manually post a message or link. Knowledge Workers may interact with a stream by sharing, saving activity, and commenting on individual items. They may filter or query a stream to find specific items and save the results to be notified of future matches.
## Custom List
Knowledge Workers can bundle a selection of streams into a custom list. A custom list supports the organization of subscribed streams and it may be selected to filter the stream of activity.
## Saved Search
Knowledge Workers can create a saved search with pre-defined keywords.  The search can be selected to quickly filter on the pre-defined key words in an activity stream.
## Organization
An organization is an operating unit within an enterprise. It is comprised of employees and groups responsible for delivering on its mission. An organization is represented by a profile page where it may communicate news and important information. The organization's activity stream aggregates the activity of its employees and groups supporting organization-wide discovery of content. An organization is responsible for promoting adoption while defining social media policies that define how the system may be used.
## Group
A group is a team of Knowledge Workers focused on an interest or objective. A group is represented by a profile page which may be declared public or private by the administrator. Members may engage in conversation within the group's activity stream by commenting on published activity.
