<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>An organization is an operating unit within an enterprise. It is comprised of employees and groups responsible for delivering on its mission. An organization is represented by a profile page where it may communicate news and important information. The organization&#8217;s channel aggregates the activity of its employees and groups supporting organization-wide discovery of content.   An organization is responsible for establishing the default configuration for employee or group profiles. If the organization&#8217;s social media policy permits, an administrator may customize a profile by choosing a theme and additional apps.</p>
