## Overview

The start page serves as a private homepage for the knowledge worker allowing them to 
organize and find the information that they need on a day to day basis. The user has access 
to a gallery where they can choose from a collection of apps that they place on their start 
page. A knowledge worker can also organize the apps on their start page by grouping them under tabs. Unlike traditional enterprise web portals, Knowledge Workers not only have complete control over the content but they may also apply a theme to change the look and feel.
